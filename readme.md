### General guidelines
You will have to configure small-scale networks. To do so, it will be necessary to understand how TCP/IP addressing works. 

You will have to complete 10 levels (i.e. 10 exercises) and turn them in your Git repository.

### Mandatory part
* This project is about solving networking problems to make a network run.
* First, download the file attached to the project’s page.
Then, extract the files in whatever folder you want.
In this folder, run the index.html file.
* For each level, a non-functioning network diagram appears.
* At the top of your window, you will see a goal to achieve: the issues to solve so that
the network runs properly. There are two buttons you can use:

	• Check again to verify whether your configuration was correct or not.
	• Get my config to download your configuration whenever you need to. It will beuseful to turn in your assignment.

* At the bottom of the page, you will see logs. They can be helpful to understand why
your configuration is wrong.
* To succeed, modify the unshaded fields until your network configuration is correct.
* To complete this assignment, it is strongly recommended to understand how addressing works in a network in which there are devices such as routers. Read about TCP/IP addressing.
